        By day, I architect software solutions using C#, ASP.NET, and SQL, transforming complex requirements into 
        elegant applications. By evening, I channel this same problem-solving mindset into teaching Bollywood dance 
        to young students aged 2-10, developing their coordination and confidence through movement.

Both disciplines share my passion for structured creativity - whether crafting clean code architecture 
        or choreographing dance routines, I thrive on designing systems that are both functional and beautiful. 
        Seeking opportunities where I can apply my technical training while maintaining the rhythm between 
        logical problem-solving and artistic expression.",
